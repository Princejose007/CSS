 Selectors in Css  

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and format HTML elements on a webpage. Selectors are the core of CSS, as they define which elements the styles will be applied to. Different types of selectors allow developers to target elements precisely and efficiently.

1. Element Selector

The element selector applies styles to all instances of a specific HTML tag. For example,

p { color: blue; }


This rule makes all paragraph text (<p>) blue. It is simple and widely used for general styling.

2. ID Selector

An ID selector targets a unique element with a specific id attribute. Since IDs are unique, this method is ideal for styling one particular element.

#header { background: lightgrey; }


This applies a light grey background to the element with id="header".

3. Class Selector

The class selector allows styling multiple elements that share the same class attribute.

.highlight { font-weight: bold; }


This makes all elements with class="highlight" bold, providing flexibility for repeated styling.

4. Universal Selector

The universal selector applies a style to all elements on the page.

* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }


It is often used to reset default browser styles and ensure consistency.

5. Group Selector

The group selector applies the same style to multiple selectors at once.

h1, h2, h3 { color: green; }

Conclusion

CSS selectors make web design efficient by targeting elements in various waysâ€”whether by type, ID, class, universally, or in groups. Understanding these selectors is essential for clean, structured, and maintainable web styling.
