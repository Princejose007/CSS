# CSS Implementation Types

This repository demonstrates the three primary methods of implementing CSS: Inline, Internal, and External. Understanding the differences between them is crucial for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient web code.

## Overview

| Type | Description | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inline CSS** | Styles are applied directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute. | Quick fixes, testing, or overriding other styles. **Not recommended for general use.** |
| **Internal CSS** | Styles are defined within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of an HTML document. | Styles that are only needed on a single specific page. |
| **External CSS** | Styles are written in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML document. | **The best practice.** Ideal for multi-page websites, promoting reusability and maintainability. |
